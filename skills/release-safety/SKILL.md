# Release Safety

## When to Use

- During architecture design to plan deployment strategy
- When designing rollback capability for a new feature
- When evaluating deployment risk for schema changes or data migrations
- When planning feature flag strategies for progressive rollout

## Rules

- Every deployment must have a rollback plan before it ships
- Database migrations must be backward compatible with the previous code version
- Feature flags for high-risk changes -- decouple deploy from release
- Canary or progressive rollout for changes with wide blast radius
- Monitor error rate and latency during rollout; define automatic rollback triggers

## Pattern

### Rollout Strategies

| Strategy       | Use When                               | Rollback Speed | Risk |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| Feature flag   | High-risk logic, gradual user exposure | Instant        | Low  |
| Canary         | Infrastructure or performance changes  | Fast (minutes) | Low  |
| Blue-green     | Full environment swap needed           | Fast (minutes) | Med  |
| Rolling update | Low-risk, stateless services           | Moderate       | Med  |
| Big bang       | Never (avoid)                          | Slow           | High |

### Database Migration Safety

**Rule**: Code must work with both old and new schema during rolling deployment.

Use skill: `backward-compatibility-analysis` for detailed expand-contract migration plans, deploy ordering for additive vs destructive schema changes, and consumer compatibility assessment.

### Feature Flag Design

- **Kill switch** -- disable feature instantly without deploy
- **Percentage rollout** -- expose to N% of users, increase gradually
- **User targeting** -- enable for internal users or beta cohort first
- **Time-boxed** -- flags must have an expiry; remove after full rollout

### Good: Specific rollout plan with rollback trigger

```
Rollout: Canary to 5% of traffic for 30 minutes
Monitor: p99 latency < 500ms, error rate < 0.1%
Rollback trigger: error rate > 0.5% or p99 > 2s for 5 minutes
Rollback action: revert to previous deployment version
DB migration: additive only (new nullable column), backward compatible
Feature flag: ENABLE_NEW_PRICING gated for internal users first, then 10% -> 50% -> 100% over 3 days
```

### Bad: No rollback plan

```
Deploy to all instances. If something breaks, we will fix it.
```

## Avoid

- Deploying without a rollback plan
- Schema migrations that break the previous code version
- Big-bang deployments for high-blast-radius changes
- Feature flags without expiry dates (flag debt)
- Rollback plans that require data migration to undo
