# Release Plan -- Staff Edition

## Purpose

Staff-level release planning that converts change descriptions into safe, production-ready rollout plans:

- **Safety-first rollout** -- every release has a rollback plan before it ships
- **Blast radius control** -- contain failures to the smallest possible scope
- **Backward compatibility** -- validate contract and schema compatibility before deployment
- **Observability readiness** -- confirm monitoring and alerting before traffic arrives
- **AI-era risk awareness** -- high code velocity with lower comprehension increases hidden coupling and drift risk

This skill runs BEFORE deployment. It focuses on risk identification and rollout safety, not code quality or performance.

## When to Use

- Before deploying a feature or change to production
- Before running a database migration in production
- When introducing a new external integration or async flow
- When upgrading dependencies or platform versions
- When deploying changes that affect shared resources or public APIs
- When traffic patterns are expected to change significantly

## Scope

Before starting the analysis, ask the user which scope they need:

| Scope    | What runs                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core     | Phases 1-8 only (risk, compatibility, rollout, rollback, etc.) |
| + Review | Core + delegate to skill: `task-code-review-advanced`          |
| + Perf   | Core + delegate to skill: `task-perf-review`                   |
| Full     | Core + Review + Performance                                    |

Default: **Core** (if the user doesn't specify, run Core only).

If the user invokes with an explicit scope argument (e.g., `/task-release-plan +review`), skip the question and use that scope directly.

## Inputs

| Input                       | Required | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature description         | Yes      | What the change does and why                                        |
| PR diff or change summary   | No       | Code changes included in the release                                |
| Architecture change summary | No       | Structural changes (new services, boundary shifts, new async flows) |
| DB migration scripts        | No       | Schema changes to be applied                                        |
| Config changes              | No       | Feature flags, environment variables, infrastructure config         |
| New external integration    | No       | Third-party APIs, services, or data sources added                   |
| Traffic expectation         | No       | Expected load change or traffic pattern shift                       |
| Dependency upgrades         | No       | Library, framework, or platform version changes                     |

Handle partial inputs gracefully. When input is missing, state what additional data would strengthen the analysis.

## Rules

- Every release must have an explicit rollback plan
- Risk assessment comes before rollout strategy recommendation
- Backward compatibility must be validated for any contract or schema change
- Database migrations must be zero-downtime safe
- Observability readiness is a deployment prerequisite, not a follow-up
- Reuse existing skills for domain-specific analysis
- Omit empty sections in output
- Keep output concise, actionable, and prioritized by risk
- When evidence is insufficient, state what is missing
- Always ask: "What happens if we need to roll this back in 10 minutes?"

## Release Planning Model

### 1. Release Risk Classification

**Run first. This frames the entire rollout plan.**

Use skill: `pr-risk-analysis` for change signal assessment.
Use skill: `blast-radius-analysis` to determine scope across code, data, and user dimensions.

Evaluate risk signals:

- Cross-module or cross-service impact
- Shared resource modification (DB, cache, queue, config)
- Database schema change
- Public API or event schema change
- New async flow or event introduction
- New external integration or dependency
- Dependency or platform upgrade
- Traffic pattern change

Use skill: `failure-classification` to identify which failure types the change is most susceptible to.

Classify:

- **Release Risk**: Low | Medium | High | Critical
- **Blast Radius**: Narrow | Moderate | Wide | Critical

Risk classification drives rollout strategy -- higher risk demands more conservative rollout.

### 2. Backward Compatibility Assessment

Use skill: `backward-compatibility-analysis` to evaluate contract and schema compatibility.

Validate:

- **API compatibility** -- are REST endpoints, request/response contracts, and status codes backward compatible?
- **Event schema compatibility** -- do event changes maintain backward compatibility for existing consumers?
- **Database compatibility** -- does the schema work with both current and previous code versions during rolling deployment?
- **Consumer impact** -- which downstream services or clients are affected?
- **Dual-write requirement** -- is a transition period needed where both old and new formats coexist?

Use skill: `api-guidelines` for API contract standards.
Use skill: `data-consistency-modeling` for consistency strategy across data boundaries.
Use skill: `idempotency` for retry safety during transition periods.

If breaking changes exist, require an expand-contract migration plan before deployment.

### 3. Database Migration Safety

**Skip if no schema changes.**

Use skill: `db-indexing` for index impact assessment.
Use skill: `transaction` for transaction scope during migration.
Use skill: `jpa-performance` for query impact of schema changes.

Evaluate:

- **Zero-downtime feasibility** -- can the migration run while the application serves traffic?
- **Expand-and-contract strategy** -- is the migration split into additive and destructive phases?
- **Lock risk** -- does the migration acquire table-level locks on large tables?
- **Index impact** -- do new indexes require long-running builds? Use `CONCURRENTLY` where supported.
- **Data backfill strategy** -- is backfill needed? Estimated duration? Batched or bulk?
- **Rollback plan** -- can the migration be reversed without data loss?

Deploy order for additive changes: code first (handle both schemas) -> migrate -> code that uses new schema.
Deploy order for destructive changes: code stops using old schema -> verify -> migrate to drop.

### 4. Rollout Strategy Recommendation

Use skill: `release-safety` for rollout, rollback, and feature flag patterns.

Select strategy based on risk classification:

| Risk Level | Recommended Strategy                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Low        | Rolling update, standard deployment                  |
| Medium     | Feature flag or canary (5-10% traffic, 30 min soak)  |
| High       | Feature flag + canary with extended soak (1-4 hours) |
| Critical   | Feature flag + canary + phased rollout over days     |

For each strategy, define:

- **Rollout stages** -- percentage and duration per stage
- **Promotion criteria** -- what signals must be green to advance
- **Rollback trigger** -- what signals trigger automatic or manual rollback
- **Soak time** -- minimum observation period before next stage

Use skill: `resiliency` for circuit breaker and timeout patterns during rollout.

### 5. Observability and Alerting Readiness

**Observability is a deployment prerequisite.**

Use skill: `observability` to evaluate signal coverage.

Verify before deployment:

- **Metrics** -- are RED metrics (Rate, Error, Duration) instrumented for affected paths?
- **Alerts** -- are alert thresholds defined for error rate and latency regressions?
- **Correlation IDs** -- are requests traceable across service boundaries?
- **Tracing** -- are trace spans covering the new or modified code paths?
- **Dashboard** -- does the team dashboard reflect the new feature or change?
- **Rollback triggers** -- are automated rollback criteria tied to observable signals?

For each gap:

- **What is missing** -- specific metric, alert, trace span, or dashboard panel
- **Why it matters for this release** -- what failure mode it would detect
- **What to add before deployment** -- concrete addition with threshold

### 6. Rollback Strategy

**Every release must answer: "How do we undo this in 10 minutes?"**

Use skill: `release-safety` for rollback patterns.
Use skill: `incident-prevention` for prevention strategies.
Use skill: `failure-propagation-analysis` to understand rollback propagation impact.

Define:

- **Code rollback** -- can the previous version be redeployed? Any state incompatibility?
- **Database rollback** -- is the migration reversible? Does rollback require compensating migration?
- **Feature flag fallback** -- can the feature be disabled without redeployment?
- **Data corruption mitigation** -- if partial writes occurred, how to detect and correct?
- **Compensating actions** -- manual or automated steps to restore consistency after rollback
- **Consumer notification** -- do downstream consumers need to be notified of rollback?

Classify rollback complexity:

| Rollback Type    | Speed   | Risk                                 |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Feature flag     | Instant | Low                                  |
| Code revert      | Minutes | Low                                  |
| Code + DB revert | Hours   | High                                 |
| No rollback      | N/A     | Critical -- requires mitigation plan |

If rollback is not feasible, define a forward-fix strategy with explicit timeline.

### 7. Dependency and Platform Risk

**Skip if no dependency or platform changes.**

Use skill: `dependency-impact-analysis` for deployment ordering and impact assessment.

Evaluate:

- **Breaking change risk** -- does the upgrade introduce breaking API or behavior changes?
- **Transitive dependency impact** -- do transitive dependencies conflict or change behavior?
- **JVM / Spring compatibility** -- is the upgrade compatible with the current runtime?
- **Runtime config impact** -- do default configurations change (thread pools, timeouts, serialization)?
- **Deployment ordering** -- must the dependency be deployed before or after dependent services?

For framework or platform upgrades (Java, Spring Boot, Jakarta EE):

- Review migration guide for breaking changes
- Verify Virtual Thread compatibility (no new `synchronized` paths)
- Test with production-like configuration, not just defaults
- Plan for rollback if runtime behavior regresses

### 8. Capacity and Load Consideration

**Skip if no traffic impact expected.**

Use skill: `capacity-modeling` for throughput estimation and bottleneck prediction.
Use skill: `caching` for cache pressure and invalidation impact.
Use skill: `concurrency-model` for concurrency risk and Virtual Thread compatibility.

Evaluate:

- **Thread pool sizing** -- are Virtual Thread or platform thread pools sized for the new load?
- **Connection pool sizing** -- do database and HTTP connection pools accommodate the change? (10-40 for Virtual Threads, not 100+)
- **Cache pressure** -- does the change invalidate existing caches or increase cache miss rate?
- **Database load** -- does the change introduce new query patterns or increase write volume?
- **Burst handling** -- can the system absorb peak traffic after rollout?

If the change introduces a new hot path or significantly changes traffic distribution, require a load test before production deployment.

### Output Constraints

- Risk classification always comes before rollout recommendation
- Findings ordered by deployment impact: compatibility > migration > rollout > observability > rollback
- Omit empty sections
- Every recommendation must be actionable and deployment-specific
- No generic deployment advice ("test thoroughly", "monitor closely")
- Prioritize by blast radius containment potential
- Optimize for token efficiency and deployment readiness

## Avoid

- Generic deployment checklists without risk-specific analysis
- Restating the full PR diff or feature description
- Code review or performance commentary (use dedicated skills)
- Recommendations without blast radius context
- Rollout plans without rollback strategy
- Database migrations without zero-downtime assessment
- Ignoring AI-generated code velocity as a contributor to hidden coupling
- Treating all releases as equal risk regardless of change scope
- Proposing overly conservative rollout for genuinely low-risk changes
